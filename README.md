## Project Overview
The SIT Bank project is a simple banking application that allows users to create bank accounts, deposit and withdraw funds, check balances, and calculate interest for savings accounts. The application is structured into a modular format, making it easy to maintain and extend.

### File Descriptions
- **Banking/__init__.py**: This file is the initialization file for the Banking module. It does not contain any code.
  
- **Banking/account.py**: This file defines the `BankAccount` class, which represents a bank account. It includes methods for getting the balance, depositing, withdrawing, and displaying the balance. It also defines two subclasses: `SavingsAccount`, which adds interest calculation, and `CurrentAccount`, which includes overdraft functionality.

- **Banking/transactions.py**: This file contains two functions, `deposit` and `withdraw`, which handle depositing and withdrawing amounts from a bank account.

- **main.py**: This file serves as the main entry point for the banking application. It allows users to create accounts, log in, deposit, withdraw, check balances, and calculate interest for savings accounts.

- **app.py**: This file serves as the Streamlit application for deploying the banking project. It provides a user interface for interacting with the banking functionalities.

## Getting Started
To run the application, ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install Streamlit using pip:

```
pip install streamlit
```

### Running the Application
To start the Streamlit application, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:
